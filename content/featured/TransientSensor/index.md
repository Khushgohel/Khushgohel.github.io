Targetting the low sensitivity of the transient electronics, a water soluble pressure sensor with micro-patterned surface was fabricated using MoS₂ Quantum Dots in water soluble polymer. Not only it demonstrated good pressure response compared to plain sensor but it also showed good humidity detection as well. Moreover electron transduction mechanism, proton hopping and stress loading phenomena concisely explains pressure and humidity sensing.
