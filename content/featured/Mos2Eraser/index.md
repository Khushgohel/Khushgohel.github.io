A flexible, eco-friendly multifunctional(strain + breath) sensor is fabricated by hydrothermally synthesizing MoS₂ on a low cost eraser substrate. Interesting temporal responses are seen when two different stimuli strain and breath were provided. Using the Machine learning algorithms on the collected data it is able to distinguish between Strain and Breath response.
