Utilized 2D nanomaterial SnS and Mxene nanohybrid to fabricate an asymmetric memristor. Materials were synthesised using low cost hydrothermal synthesis and centrifugation. Asymetric memristive switching phenomena is explained using band diagrams for SnS/Mxene, Ion transport mechanism and by analyzing device IV curves.
