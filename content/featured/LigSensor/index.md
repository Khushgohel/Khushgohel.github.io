Sythesized Laser Induced Graphene(LIG) by blue laser ablating PolyImide resin coated whatman paper. Synthesised LIG was tranferred to flexible acrylic tape for utilization as low cost flexible strain sensor. Furthermore, this method can be used to develop flexible electrodes for various application like supercapacitor, electrochemical sensing, etc.
