- Performed TCAD simulations to reduce Self Heating Effects in AlGaN/GaN HEMT at high output power (40W/mm) by integrating peripheral Diamond Heat Spreaders for multi-way heat extraction
- Researching on the growth of III-Nitrides via Metal Organic Chemical Vapour Deposition (MOCVD) and its hetero-junctions for improving HEMT device DC and AC performance.
- Building an High Pressure confined Chemical Vapur Depostion (HPcCVD) system from the ground up for conformal deposition of amorphous Si for photonics application.
- Created system flow diagrams and standard operating procedures for other users to get acquainted with the HPcCVD system.
